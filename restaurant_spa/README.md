My complete remake of a nice-looking template I found online.

The original has a lot of components created by libraries such as [Nivo Lightbox](https://github.com/Codeinwp/Nivo-Lightbox-jQuery) and [Isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/), which were the components that motivated me to recreate the template. I used [fancyBox](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/) instead of Lightbox because I had a lot of trouble with file paths (and still used Isotope for filtering the images).
