site: www.uci-test.surge.sh

This was one of the more advanced sites I have created, and I do not use any JS or Bootstrap.

I wanted to focus on just creating the various responsive components that UCI's site had (I thought their site was gorgeous).

I recreated UCI's front page almost completely (layout-wise) without the use of Bootstrap. I'm pretty in love with flex boxes now (for the overlay columns and footer columns). The site is responsive and has break points at around 1000px and 728px to imitate how UCI implemented their site's (www.uci.edu) responsiveness.
