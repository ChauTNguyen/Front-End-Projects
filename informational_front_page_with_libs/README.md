site: www.uci-test-2.surge.sh

This was cloned from my old repo: https://github.com/ChauTNguyen/Front-End-Projects/tree/master/informational_front_page

The intent of this iteration was to create a separate project that more accurately resembled UCI's actual website.

This time, I used Bootstrap and jQuery as I did not want to write all the dropdown and scrolling logic. You'll find that there's a lot of old unchanged code; I did NOT rewrite the entire project using Bootstrap classes and jQuery
functions. I simply appended my new code to make the site cooler!
