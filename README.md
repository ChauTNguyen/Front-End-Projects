A collection of my front-end projects I'm doing recently. I'm going to finish at least one site every 2-3 days to practice my front-end & design skills. Each site has the necessary dependencies included within package.json. I'm using gulp to manage my workflow.

**Some of the sites that I have created are recreations of other sites, but they are _always created with my own code from the ground up_ (90% of it at least :) ).**

Sometimes I change certain elements as well (maybe a different menu, different animations, etc), or don't implement certain elements to practice implementing features without libraries. Sometimes I copy small JS snippets as well to implement certain things (like smooth scrolling). Anyways, enjoy!
