Simple web design idea copied from http://www.erondu.com/.
I tackled my CSS from a different approach: for the image scaling I simply set image's width to be 50% of the container as it was a lot easier that way. My site overall is pretty responsive, and I personally find that it looks a lot better in different orientations (mostly the position of the image, I have it fixed while his seems to change into a static position at certain points, making the image not properly display on the screen when scrolling).
