An fairly decent site that uses Bootstrap and jQuery for the foundation. I wrote a lot of custom CSS (~330 lines) to make the site very responsive, as well as added a custom menu and many other features. I decided to make my menu much shorter as I thought it looked much better design-wise.

A lot of my CSS differs from the original site's CSS as I felt like semantically my CSS declarations made a lot more sense.

Overall, this site was really fun to make, and the development process was shortened significantly by using Bootstrap, jQuery, Pug, and Sass.
