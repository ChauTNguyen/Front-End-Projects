An fairly decent site that uses Bootstrap and jQuery for the foundation. I wrote a lot of custom CSS (~330 lines) to make the site very responsive, as well as added a custom menu and many other features. I decided to make my menu much shorter as I thought it looked much better design-wise.

A lot of my CSS differs from the original site's CSS as I felt like semantically my CSS declarations made a lot more sense. Minor thing: the original site's compact menu, when on landscape for smaller mobile devices, is completely messes up; I assume it was not accounted for at all. I fixed it in my imitation of the site though.

Overall, this site was really fun to make, and the development process was shortened significantly by using Bootstrap, jQuery, Pug, and Sass.
